# M3 — Firmware Updates (fwupd/LVFS): Status

**State:** IN PROGRESS. **Branch:** `feature/m3` (single milestone PR, rebase-merged).
**Objective (ROADMAP):** Firmware page — device list, versions, release notes, metadata
refresh, updates via fwupd D-Bus (its polkit governs), reboot-required and progress states.
**Close = tag `v0.4.0` and the BETA release.**

**Transport decision:** ADR-0009 — `Fwupd.Client` (GObject Introspection over libfwupd), not
raw `Gio.DBusConnection` calls. `python-dbusmock` ships no fwupd template (the M2
retrospective's assumption was wrong — confirmed against upstream at M3 start); tests use a
small local template built from `dbusmock`'s `SKELETON`.

## Commit plan

- [x] C1 `docs: open milestone M3` — status file, ADR-0009 (firmware transport).
- [ ] C2 `feat(core): firmware models, ports, errors` — `FirmwareDevice`/`FirmwareRelease`/
      `UpdateState` models, `core/firmware_policy.py` (pure: AC/battery precondition,
      update-state text mapping), `FirmwareProvider` port, `FirmwareInstallFailed` error.
- [x] C3+C4 `provider: fwupd via libfwupd` — landed as ONE commit (the install/progress
      mechanics were inseparable from the transport spike): device list, upgrades/releases,
      remotes + metadata refresh, `install()` with `on_progress`, change signals. Local
      dbusmock template; fixture-free (live D-Bus state, not a filesystem capture —
      documented as a deviation in module docs). Three findings that reshaped the design,
      all recorded in ADR-0009/module docstring: (1) `Fwupd.Client` sync helpers free their
      per-call `GMainContext`, leaving the internal proxy bound to freed memory — every
      client needs `set_main_context()` with a persistent context or the process crashes on
      the next daemon signal; (2) the client's GObject signals and battery getters only work
      after an async `connect_async()`, so change/progress/battery use raw GDBus
      subscriptions/`GetAll` instead; (3) `install_release()` runs via `asyncio.to_thread`
      on a dedicated client — on 26.04's native scheduler, coroutines execute on the GTK
      main thread, and a minutes-long flash there would freeze the UI. Test infrastructure:
      one session-wide private system bus (two `DBusTestCase` classes each starting/stopping
      their own bus leaves Gio's singleton connection dead — process abort).
- [x] C5+C6 `feat(ui): Firmware page + update flow` — landed as ONE commit (the page and
      the flow share one view-model): device list with per-device update availability and
      per-device degradation; metadata refresh action (failure = toast, never a page
      state); battery precondition surfaced BEFORE commit; progress via busy banner;
      reboot-required banner computed from fwupd update states; failure banner with retry;
      post-update "what changed"; lock emblem on Install; declined auth = quiet toast
      (ADR-0004). Also fixes a packaging gap: `core/firmware_policy.py` and
      `providers/fwupd.py` were missing from `src/meson.build` install lists (the .deb
      would have crashed at import). **Read-only surface validated on the real E16 Gen 2**
      (container + host system-bus mount, AppArmor unconfined for the probe): 20 devices
      mapped, real NOTHING_TO_DO→[] path hit, battery precondition (62%, 25%) read live.
- [x] C7 `docs: fwupd module doc + quirks` — providers.md fwupd section (8 quirks, all
      evidence-backed), adding-a-provider guide gains the D-Bus/GIR reference pointers.
- [ ] C8 `docs: close milestone M3; release v0.4.0 (BETA)`.

## Acceptance criteria (from ROADMAP)

- [ ] Full update flow verified on real hardware against LVFS — **see deferral below**; the
      read-only surface (device list, available upgrades, refresh metadata) is validated
      against the E16 Gen 2's real fwupd where the host environment allows it, but the
      *install* path needs an interactive polkit GUI prompt no headless agent can drive.
- [ ] Failure paths render correctly (dbusmock-scripted: install failure, needs-reboot)
- [ ] Unambiguous reboot flow
- [ ] Failure recovery path (retry without restarting the whole page)
- [ ] AC/battery preconditions surfaced before commit
- [ ] Post-update "what changed" (release notes shown after a successful install)
- [ ] Declined auth is silent (quiet degradation, no error page — ADR-0004)
- [ ] `./check` + smoke green both LTS; full lane green at close (verified on tag)
- [ ] Tag `v0.4.0`; GitHub pre-release published (BETA); CHANGELOG; ROADMAP

## Known deferrals / notes

- **Real-hardware *install* validation is out of reach for an autonomous agent by design**:
  fwupd's own polkit policy requires an interactive human at a GUI auth prompt (ADR-0004) —
  the same boundary that makes the privilege model safe makes it impossible to script. The
  maintainer must manually verify at least one real install on the E16 Gen 2 before this
  milestone is truly production-trustworthy; until then, the D-Bus/UI plumbing is verified via
  dbusmock and the manual matrix entry stays open. Same deferral shape as M2's "real UPower
  bus" item.
- python-dbusmock has no fwupd template; a local one lives under `tests/dbusmock_templates/`.
- No fixture-corpus entry for `fwupd` — device/release data is live daemon state, not a
  filesystem tree; the local dbusmock template's scripted responses serve the role fixtures
  play for other providers.
